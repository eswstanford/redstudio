Renewable Energy Design Studio

Stanford students in the REDI project will assist in the feasibility study of a 200-kW microhydro plant (the Ciptagelar Plant), with the goal of developing an improved methodology that IBEKA and REwiRE can use in planning future projects.  A major barrier to mini-grid investment is the relatively high planning and design cost of each individual project. To streamline feasibility studies, we will develop an open-source software program to aid users in the design of grid-connected and standalone microhydro systems. This tool will integrate data on site surveys, material availability, and past projects to facilitate component selection and electric grid layout for new projects. In addition to the computer tool, we will design the data-gathering process for microhydro feasibility studies â€“ a procedure that will then be implemented for the Ciptagelar Plant.
